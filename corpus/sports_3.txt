Jake Paul Calls Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. 'a Dumb Boxer' for Mike Tyson Comments

Jake Paul fired back at Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. ahead of their boxing match later this month.

In response to Chavez saying he wanted to get "revenge" on Paul for his win over the legendary Mike Tyson in November, Paul told TMZ that he isn't concerned about the 39-year-old's motivations for their June 28 showdown in Anaheim.

"I think he's just a dumb boxer trying to protect the sport," Paul said around the 3:30 mark. "There's no revenge needed for Mike; it was a successful night, the most-watched boxing event ever, Mike made a ton of money, and he did good in the fight."

Paul and Tyson faced each other in the first combat sports event to be streamed live on Netflix. The spectacle drew record-breaking viewership numbers, and both Paul and Tyson took home reported fight purses well over eight figures.

The 28-year-old added that he feels Chavez is making a poor attempt to try to gain fan support ahead of their fight.

"Chavez is just trying to get fans to get behind him to be like, 'Oh yeah, he's gonna get him for Mike!' And it's just gonna completely fail," Paul said.
